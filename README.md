# Pri-MCCD_Technical-Validation

This repository provides baseline model evaluation and feature analysis code for the Pri-MCCD dataset, a multimodal classroom climate dataset collected from real-world primary school lessons. The code supports pilot studies, ablation experiments, and acoustic feature analysis using standard multimodal pipelines.

## ‚úÖ Baseline Model Validation (SRC Section)

We provide a reproducible baseline using standard GRU encoders and transformer-based fusion. This is intended to establish initial accuracy and robustness on Pri-MCCD's multimodal emotion/climate classification task.

### üîß Example command for test :

```bash
python main.py \
  --visual_encoder_type gru \
  --acoustic_encoder_type gru \
  --save_name gru_trans \
  --use_transformer_fusion
```

You can adjust `--visual_encoder_type` and `--acoustic_encoder_type` to test various combinations (e.g., `tcn`, `lstm`), and optionally disable fusion components for further ablation.

## üîç IS09 Acoustic Feature Analysis

The script `IS09_analysis.py` performs statistical inspection of the acoustic feature distributions across labeled classroom climate conditions. It includes:

* **Mean Pitch Distribution**
* **Energy Standard Deviation**
* **F0 Standard Deviation**
* **Stacked Climate Proportions** by acoustic indicators

These indicators reflect underlying affective cues and help interpret the contribution of acoustic modality in multimodal fusion.

Run the script via:

```bash
python IS09_analysis.py
```

It will generate visualizations and aggregated metrics stored .

## üìä Experimental Goals

* Evaluate basic multimodal architectures on Pri-MCCD
* Assess the role of audio-visual encoders and fusion mechanisms
* Interpret key acoustic indicators aligned with classroom climate theory
* Provide reproducible experimental baselines for future research
